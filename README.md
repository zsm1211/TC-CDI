## Abstract
Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), as a lensless imaging technique, can achieve a high-resolution image with intensity and phase information from a diffraction pattern. To capture high speed and high spatial-resolution scenes, we propose a temporal compressive CDI system. A two-step algorithm using physics-driven deep-learning networks is developed for multi-frame spectra reconstruction and phase retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can reconstruct up to 8(20) frames from a snapshot measurement. Our results offer huge potential for visualizing the dynamic process of molecules with large field-of-view, high spatial and temporal resolutions.

Figure 1.Reconstruction results for the complicated object. (a) Coded measurement; (b) Reference images of the moving object; (c) reconstructed spatial spectra; (d) 8 corresponding reconstructed spatial images by HIO algorithm; (e) 8 corresponding reconstructed spatial images by the proposed DNN-HIO algorithm. Boxes of different colors circle the parts where the contrast between the two results is more obvious.
