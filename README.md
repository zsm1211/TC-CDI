## Abstract
Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), as a lensless imaging technique, can achieve a high-resolution image with intensity and phase information from a diffraction pattern. To capture high speed and high spatial-resolution scenes, we propose a temporal compressive CDI system. A two-step algorithm using physics-driven deep-learning networks is developed for multi-frame spectra reconstruction and phase retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can reconstruct up to 8(20) frames from a snapshot measurement. Our results offer huge potential for visualizing the dynamic process of molecules with large field-of-view, high spatial and temporal resolutions.
